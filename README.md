## Data Structure and Algorithms
<h1>Assignments (50% of Final Course Grade) â€“ COMP605</h1>
<h3>The aim of these four java programs is to improve your programming skills and to give you a
basic understanding of commonly used data structures and algorithms. Zip and upload each
program to the relevant link in moodle. Name the file as: FirstName_LastName_Assignment_(number)
For marking:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>You have to attend the lab to demonstrate your code</li>
    <li>Answer questions</li>
    <li>Apply simple modifications</li>
</ol>
<p>Not attending the lab for marking will result in zero mark. I may deduct marks if you are
unable to demonstrate and explain code or apply simple modifications. During classes, I will
discuss these programs with you and give you more help and guidance. It is important that
you attend all classes!</P.>
