<p>Create a program that will display the output given below. You will need to make use of the Escape Sequence characters to format the text correctly. Hints: the backslash (\) and the double quotes (‚Äú) are both special characters. To make them appear in a string as normal characters, both need a backslash in front of them. For example, ‚Äú\\‚Äù gives a single backslash as a normal character, whereas ‚Äú\‚Äù‚Äù gives a double quotes character.</p>
<p>Note, do not format the output by manually inserting whitespace characters.</p>

<p>Write a program that asks from the user for a number (data type: double) as the radius of a circle. Calculate area and perimeter of the circle and display the results in a tabular format. Note, the results should be rounded up to two decimal points by using composite formatting. The following are the formula for calculating circle area and perimeter.
area = radius * radius ‚àó ùúã
perimeter = radius ‚àó 2 ‚àó ùúã Where, ùúã = Math.PI</p>

<p>Write a program that asks from the user for the letter of a play card. The user input must be either J, Q, K, or A. Your solution should allow user to type in either upper or lower case. Perform user input validation. If user input is not one of the four specified letters, your program must prompt for re-entry until a valid input is received. Once a valid letter is received, a selection statement should be used to display corresponding messages based on the following:</p>

<p>The New Zealand Weather Met Office uses a series of sensors scattered around the country recording temperatures at various locations. In this program, the user will simulate the sensors by entering the data. Your program will first ask from the user for how many sensors are currently being deployed. The received number is then used (as array capacity) to create an array of temperatures (data type: double). The program then uses a loop to read the temperature values from the user and save in the array (Hint: you‚Äôll have to use the array length to control the iteration of the loop). Your program should calculate and display the average temperature.</p>

<p>Write a program that that asks the user to guess the country name based on a displayed capital city. The user has the choice to enter up to three country names, in one line separated by a comma. Display a warning if user has typed more than three names. (Optional requirement: in the case of receiving more
than three names, continue to prompt user for re-entry until exactly three names are received) There are many ways to solve the problem. A suggested approach is store the capital cities and corresponding country names in two separate arrays (or lists), with the country and its capital having the same index in the two arrays (or lists). The table below gives six countries and their capitals. Generate a random number between 0-5 (including 0 and 5). One way to generate a random number is to use ‚ÄúThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(<inclusive_lower_bound>, <exclusive_upper_bound>)‚Äù. Make sure to import the package ‚Äújava.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom‚Äù at the beginning of program. The random number is used as index to retrieve both a capital city from the capital city array (or list), and
the corresponding country name (which would be the correct answer). You can assume the user will enter the country names in the correct case (i.e., first letter capitalised).</p>

<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter two lines of comma-separated numbers (data type: double), and count the total number of overlapping numbers between the two lines. There are many ways to solve this problem. One possible approach is split each line into an array (of numeric strings), convert the two string arrays to two arrays (double[]), use two nested loops (one inside another) to iterate through the two arrays (double[]) and calculate the total number of overlapping
numbers of the two arrays. Note, you do not have to input-check whether the user has typed all numeric values. But you should not assume that the two lines contain the same number of values. In the sample run below, the first line contains 6 numbers (1, 3, 7.0, 8.0, 10.5, and 11.5), whereas the second contains 4 numbers (2.5, 7, 8, and 10.5), and there are 3 overlapping values between the two.</p>

<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter a line of comma-separated temperature recordings. You can assume that the user will only enter numeric values. Your program should then calculate the average temperature, the maximum temperature, and the number of temperatures between 0 - 10 (including 0 and 10).</p>
