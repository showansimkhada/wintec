<h1>Assignment 1: Arrays and simple algorithms</h1>
<h3>Write a Java program that reads a text file (inputassignment1.txt) which includes 20 numbers
(integers). Your program should print to the screen the following:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>The minimum number.</li>
    <li>The position of the minimum number.</li>
    <li>The number of prime numbers.</li>
    <li>The average number.</li>
    <li>>The number of numbers that are bigger than the average number.</li>
    <li>A statement to indicate whether all numbers are equal or not.</li>
    <li>A statement to indicate whether all numbers are different or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your program should include at least six different methods excluding the main method.
** This is a simple program and I expect all students to be able to write it without any
problems. If you have problems I will help you during the labs.
** Can NOT use Java built in data structures.
** Build your own inputassignment1.txt file.</p>

## JAVA
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
