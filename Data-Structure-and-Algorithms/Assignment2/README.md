<h1>Assignment 2: Lists</h1>
<h3>Assume that file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt contain an unknown number of integers (text
format) and assume that the numbers in each file are unique (different). Write a Java program
that:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Reads the integers in file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt and inserts them into doubly
        linked lists list1, list2 and list3 respectively. Add the integers to the tail of the list.</li>
    <li>Prints to the screen the size of each list.</li>
    <li>Print to the screen the “Middle” number of each list.</li>
    <li>Prints to the screen the prime numbers in each list (five numbers each line)</li>
    <li>>Prints to the screen the numbers in each list in reverse order.</li>
    <li>Prints to the screen all the numbers that appear in the three lists (intersection)</li>
</ol>
<p>** No use of built in java data structures and built in methods
** I will give you examples and help during the labs.</p>

## JAVA
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
