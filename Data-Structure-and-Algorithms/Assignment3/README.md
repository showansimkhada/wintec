<h1>Assignment 3: Binary search tree</h1>
<h3>Similar to assignment 2, assume that file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt contain an unknown
number of integers (text format) and assume that the numbers in each file are unique. Write a
Java program that:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Reads the integers in file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt and inserts them into binary
        search trees bst1, bst2 and bst3 respectively.</li>
    <li>Prints to the screen the size of each tree.</li>
    <li>Prints to the screen the numbers in each tree in increasing order.</li>
    <li>Prints the height of each binary search tree.</li>
    <li>Prints the numbers in the binary search tree “level by level”.</li>
    <li>Print the number of prime numbers in the second binary search tree.</li.>
</ol>
<p>** No use of built in Java data structures.
** I will give you examples and help during the labs.</p>

## JAVA
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
