<h1>Assignment 4: Hash table and Big O notation [13%]</h1>
<h3>The aim of this assignment is to implement and to apply the basic operations of hash table
and to do basic running time analysis (Big o notation)</h3>
<h2>Part A – Coding [50 marks]</h2>
<h3>Assume that file1.txt contains an unknown number of strings (terms) (text format). Write a
Java program that uses the built-in hash table and prints to the screen the term with
maximum frequency.</h3>
<p>** You are allowed to use the internal (built-in) hash table implementation.
** Build your own file1.txt for testing.</p>
<h2>Part B – Big O Analysis [50 marks]</h2>
<h3>Assume the sizes of file1.txt is 𝑂(𝑛)(the number of words (strings) in each file is𝑂(𝑛)).
Provide a detailed worst case analysis and average case analysis of your implementation.
Feel free to use the average case analysis and the worst case analysis of the operations of
hash table as provided in the table below.</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Average case</th>
        <th>Worst case</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Insert</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
        <td>O(n)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Search</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
        <td>O(n)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Hash table
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## JAVA
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
